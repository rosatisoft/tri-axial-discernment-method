# Tri-Axial Method of Discernment (F–C–P)

This repository contains the conceptual and operational resources for the **Tri-Axial Method of Discernment**, a framework for evaluating information, claims, and decisions using three simultaneous axes:

1. **Foundation (F)** — factual grounding / evidence
2. **Context (C)** — situational frame, motivations, and external forces
3. **Principle (P)** — systemic and ethical implications of action

The method is designed to be usable by both **human agents** and **AI systems**, and is described in detail in the working paper:

> Published as a preprint on Zenodo.
